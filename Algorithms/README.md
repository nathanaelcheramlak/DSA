# Algorithms (C++)

Here I have made a collection of sorting and searching algorithms. It is made so that it displays the Time and Space complexities of each algorithm and a description of how they work.

### Sorting Algorithms

- Simple Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort

### Searching Algorithms

- Linear Search
- Binary Search
